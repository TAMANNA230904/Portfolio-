                      I am pursuing my B.Tech in AI/ML. I
                      completed my schooling from Carmel Convent School.
                      Throughout my academic career,I consistently achieved
                      top ranks in my school and college. My aggregate CGPA is
                      8.89. My interests lie in Programming and Machine
                      Learning. I have strong knowledge about Data Structures
                      and Algorithms. I have worked on various machine learning
                      projects and have various certifications. I always try to
                      learn new things and adapt to new technologies. My
                      greatest strengths are my perseverance and dedication towards what I do. I love singing and have been learning to
                      play guitar these days. I enjoy writing in a journal because it brings a sense of nostalgia, keeping me connected
                      to the simpler times when we used to write in notebooks, offering a refreshing break from this fast-paced digital world.
